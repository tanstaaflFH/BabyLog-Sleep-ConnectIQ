# BabyLog: Sleep
A Widget for Garmin ConnectIQ (currently: VivoActive3 / Music)

## Intention
This is a simple widget used to mark / log the times your baby sleeps.
I created this during my parental leave to help me remember how long the baby slept.

The data is directly stored on the device.
The last 10 sleeps are stored.

## Use
- Tap on the purple button at the top to start or stop a sleep.
- Tap on the three dots at the bottom to open the log screen with the ten last sleep times.
- On the second screen:
-- Scroll up and down to see all ten entries
-- Swipe left to go back

## Disclaimer
This is my second ConnectIQ app and I tailored it completely to my wishes / needs.
It may or may not be improved in the future.
Feel free to send me any comments.
